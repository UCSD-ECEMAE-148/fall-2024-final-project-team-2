All metric hardware was used, a mix of m2 and m4 bolts, with the only glued component being the decorative spoiler which was acylic solvent welded. The goal for the design was not only to be extremly compact and look good, but also not hinder the functionality and serviceability of the robot as much as possible. In order to retain quick access to the battery, the side skirts were designed to press fit into place, allowing us to change batteries without needing any tools during our testing.
