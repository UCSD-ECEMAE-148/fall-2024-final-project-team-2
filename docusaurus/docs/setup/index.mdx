# Mechanics and Electronics

Excecuting a great final project wasn't just implementing pose estimation, it also meant a neat fit and finish and sleek design that would make our robot stand out.

The first step of this was sourcing and wiring the all the electronic hardware that would power our bot. Powering our robot is an NVidia jetson Nano and Flipsky FSESC V6, a VESC based speed controller. The mechanical base of our bot was a TRAXXAS Slash 1/10 scale RC truck. For sensors, we utilized an OAK-D camera with RGBD capablitiies, an LD06 2D lidar, a Ublox GNSS board, and course we needed some miscealanous components such as Wifi adapters, Buck converters, and a servo power distribution board. You can see below the wiring diagram of our robot:
