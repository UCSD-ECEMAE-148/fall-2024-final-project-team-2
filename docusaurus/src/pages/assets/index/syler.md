Hi I'm Syler Sylvester. 

I am in the last quarter of my undergraduate program at UCSD. I will be receiving my B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a depth in Machine Learning & Controls, then start my master's program at UCSD in Intelligent Systems, Robotics, & Controls. 

Outside of school, I spend the majority of my time with friends, going to our favorite spots in San Diego. I also have been working with a startup and **[ARCLab](https://ucsdarclab.com/)** at UCSD along with my school work. I would like to pursue a career in robotics and stay in San Diego if possible.
