I'm a 5th-year Electrical Engineering student at UCSD specializing in **Machine Learning and Controls**. Passionate about **system design** for **scalability** and **reusability**, I focus on improving my skills in building efficient, maintainable code. 

In my spare time, I work on **robotics** with **[Triton AI](http://triton-ai.eng.ucsd.edu/)**, contributing to F1Tenth and **[Indy Autonomous Challenge](https://www.indyautonomouschallenge.com/)**.

I am also an avid C++ enthusiast, and enjoy broadening my knowledge through **[CppCon](https://cppcon.org/)**.
